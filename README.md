Focused, offline-first writing canvas with paranoid backups.

## Getting Started

1. Run a local static server (service workers require a server):
   `python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. Open `http://localhost:8080` and start writing.

Your text and backups are stored locally in IndexedDB. Export and import use plain text files.
